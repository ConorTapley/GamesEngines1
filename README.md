In this project I intend to create an procedural genrated infinite galaxy with randomised planets being infinitly spawned around the player (spaceship). Im going to generate a mountainous terrain on the planets using code which i hope to add textures to that change depending on their amplitude for example snow at the top of the mountain, then rock, then grass etc.
