In this project I intend to create an procedural genrated environment much like minecraft but more realistic. Im going to use perlin noise to generate a mountainous terrain which i hope to add textures to that change depending on their amplitude for example snow at the top of the mountain, then rock, then grass etc. I also hope to have a player that can fly around the scene.
